							<p>Mardani Fine Minerals is the flagship gallery of industry leaders, Daniel Trinchillo and Marisa Chung of <a href="http://www.finemineral.com" class="email" target="_blank">Fine Minerals International</a>. Rooted in Daniel’s signature, “taste-making” curation, Mardani is a place where visitors can experience fine mineral specimens in a unique and contemporary gallery setting.</p>
                            <p>Daniel’s love of minerals was sparked at age eight, while he was “excavating” in his neighbor’s yard. After examining dozens of examples, he came across an unusual paving stone with red specks that stood out among the hundreds. Exhilarated, he raced home with his treasure and although it turned out to be of negligible value, his love of minerals was sparked for life. Today, with twenty-four years of experience in the private mineral industry, he is one of the top dealers of his field. Every endeavor he has taken has been in an effort to out-do himself in finding the next best mineral, and it has taken him to mines, private collections and museums across the globe.</p>
                            <p>In November 2014, Daniel and his wife, Marisa opened Mardani so that they could inspire the same sense of awe in minerals that he first felt as a child, treasure-hunting outdoors. Although a retail space, Mardani’s ultimate mission has always been to share and help educate the public about minerals. Mardani seeks to reach those both new and well-seasoned in the hobby of collecting. Visitors are encouraged to not just view the minerals, but to really enjoy them by sharing their mineral stories, asking questions and sitting down in our living area to peruse the various reference materials available. In one word, the ultimate mission of Mardani is to inspire the world with these wonderful examples of natural art, and we hope you will visit us and share in the experience.

                                        <p>Daniel is the president and founder of Fine Minerals International.

Daniel has since made hundreds of trips across the globe in search of only the finest minerals, and has propelled his company into the forefront of the mineral collecting community. In 2003 he met his wife, Marisa Chung who brought her financial expertise and refined design influence into the fold. Their endeavors include the ownership and operation of several mines, the development of a number of highly regarded private collections, and the adjunct curation of the Lyda Hill Gems & Minerals Hall of the <a href="http://www.perotmuseum.org/" class="email" target="_blank">Perot Museum of Nature and Science</a> in Dallas, TX. In 2014, Daniel and Marisa co-founded, Mardani Fine Minerals as a public gallery space to share exceptional minerals with the world.</p>
